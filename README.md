A logistic regression was conducted in software program R to assess the relationship between tumor status (malignant, benign) and nine potential explanatory variables (Adhes, Chrom, Epith, Mitos, NNucl, BNucl, Thick, UShap, USize). The steps of this analysis include identifying significant explanatory variables, stepwise procedure for model selection, internally validating the model, determining the goodness of fit, assessing predictive power and producing relevant statistics about independent variables. Variable selection methods include stepwise backward elimination and forward selection procedures. AIC scores, ROC curvature, AUC values and predictive power of the models were considered in the model creation process. Residual analysis was used to determine the fit of candidate models using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each model using various cutoff values.
